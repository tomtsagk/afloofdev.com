## Where does "Dark Dimension" come from?

When I was young, I naively decided not express any negative emotions
to other people. This wasn't ideal as after some time, they bottled up
and needed an outlet.

At some point I started expressing all those emotions through art.
Every time I would draw a picture or develop a new
game, they would be inspired by a negative feeling. After a while,
there were multiple pieces of work sharing the same fantasy universe.

That's when the name **Dark Dimension** was born, to describe that place.
