A puzzle game about running, not because one has somewhere to be,
but because one has somewhere they don't want to be.

In this game, you have to run away. Different doors are blocking the way, that need to be unlocked to proceed as fast as possible. Each door will give a different benefit, and a combination of them is the key to succeed .. or fail.
