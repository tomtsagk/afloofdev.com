![Rue particle system](@ROOT@/images/games/rue/post_rue_v0.2.3.gif "Rue particle system")

My 3D card game "Rue" just got a small update.

It now has the first 5 stages, that need to be completed in order and some other small new additions. Also a big bug that would cause shaders to not compile correctly on some hardware has been fixed.

The biggest new feature is that its compilation process has been improved, and the game is now available in the <a class="button" href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/p/rue-card-game/9nn5mtm0vbkc">Microsoft Store</a>.
