## Added feature: Screen orientation change on Android

I've added screen orientation change support on my Android games. This is a feature that most games don't really need, but I feel like it makes them more flexible.

This has been updated on both
<a class="menu" href="/games/shuffled_nightmares">Shuffled Nightmares</a>
and
<a class="menu" href="/games/the_king_is_gone">The king is gone</a>
, and will also be part on all future games.
