## Project Rose: Progress

Progress of my current game in development "Project Rose".

Shows a sample game with 8 players, within a couple of turns. Each player is dealt 5 cards. Then each player in turn, play 1 card face down on the table. Once all players are done, each card is being revealed, and their effect is activated.

The card effects are still under the design phase. I would say the game is about 20% complete.
