## The king is gone, now on Android

![The king is gone on Android](/images/news/the_king_is_gone-android.png "The king is gone playing on a tablet and a phone")

My previous puzzle game
<a class="menu" href="/games/the_king_is_gone">The king is gone</a>
is now available for Android.

The only difference is the input method, where the user needs to touch and drag their finger to look around, and tap once to select an option.

Also I've removed the leaderboards on the android version for now.

It has been optimised to look well and behave on both phones and tablets. There is also a free demo version, for those curious enough.

Check it out on <a class="button" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.darkdimension.the_king_is_gone">Google Play</a>
