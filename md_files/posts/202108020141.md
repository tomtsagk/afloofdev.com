## New video game "Rue", alpha version available

![Rue cover](../images/games/rue/cover.png "Rue cover")

I'd like to present my newest video game "Rue", previously known as "Project Rose". This is a card game, where all players sit around a table, with a rose moving from around.

The aim of the game is for each player to deduct the opponent's moves and influence the rose to end in the player's side.

This project is available for free, and is also open-sourced.

It is currently in Alpha, having just the base game implemented. There's a few features and some polish planned, but until then feel free to enjoy the game. It is available for Windows, Linux and Android.

Check out its web page: <a class="menu" href="@ROOT@/games/rue.html">Rue</a>
