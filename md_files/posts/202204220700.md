##New intro animations made using Shaders

I recently played around again with OpenGL shaders, and I made these three animations of the Dark Dimension logo.

![Dark Dimension animation 3: Vortex](/images/posts/202204220700/animated_3.gif "Animation: Vortex")

These are all made using vertex and fragment shaders, and displayed at runtime. One of them will be the one used on the intro of my video game "Rue".
