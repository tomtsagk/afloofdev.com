##checkers error

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/1CQe7TA.png" style="width:400px"/>

i was experimenting with giving different colors to each vertex.
then i decided to edit the colors to give some sort of "fake lighting" on them. one thing led to another,
and when i compiled and run the game i got a checkers thingy! no that's not a texture!

##undefined behaviour

<iframe src='https://my.mixtape.moe/kdrkti.webm' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' allowfullscreen width='640' height='364'></iframe>

here i was trying to make a font. but i did something wrong (with pointers obviously) which
brought some undefined behavior. i'm not sure why visually it's behaving like this, but i loved it!

##manual matrix rotation

<iframe src='https://my.mixtape.moe/safxdi.webm' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' allowfullscreen width='640' height='364'></iframe>

my inner perfectionist wanted to do matrix rotation manually (just so I could understand what is happening).
i learned how to do euler's rotation for 1 axis. tried to study quaternions. gave up (for now).
then a wild idea came, "why not use euler's rotation on multiple axis?". well, the result is what happened on the video. 
at least my curiosity is satisfied.

##undefined shader colors

<iframe src='https://my.mixtape.moe/jnexix.webm' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' allowfullscreen width='640' height='364'></iframe>

the only thing i did was to supply to the shaders (that expect colors) an uninitialized pointer.
i was expecting that it would be random colors (like in the video) but I thought it wouldn't change.
