##ddt - deedee tools

06.2016 - 2017 | C library | alpha

tools to aid in game development. the aim of these tools is to add an abstract
layer at drawing graphics, in such a way that it would be possible for a game
to be made once and compile everywhere (even on devices/platforms that do not
exist yet). it also includes a custom rasterizer, in order to allow 3d graphics
even on devices that do not support it. (so far it's only on a software level).

##byte world project

02.2017 - 04.2017

a project to create 3d graphics, while avoiding floats. although
 I'm mainly making this to practise the math behing rasterization,
my aim with this project is to make "lightweight" 3d graphics,
that can run even on a software level. obviously a game without floats has
lots of limitations (especially on rotations) but I find it creative

**update**: this project has been fused with ddt and is no longer active
