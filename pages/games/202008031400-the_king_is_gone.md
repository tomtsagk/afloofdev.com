A game about running away, not because one has somewhere to go, but because one has somewhere they
don't want to be in.

The aim of this game is to run away as fast as possible. Doors block your path, which have to be unlocked
to continue. Each door will give a specific benefit, which will making escaping easier ... or harder.
