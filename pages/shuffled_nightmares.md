###Description

The aim of this puzzle is to use the "Control Points" to rotate the parts of each nightmare, so that it shows the complete image.
Each of the 12 level is more difficult than the previous one. The Control Points start appearing closer to each other, and their behaviour changes, to pose a bigger challenge.

There is an extra random mode, which uses the same nightmares, but in new and challenging patterns.

###Controls

`awsd`: move selection around

`<Space>`: confirm choice
