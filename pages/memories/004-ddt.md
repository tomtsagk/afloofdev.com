## ddt - Deedee Tools

`06.2016 - 2017` | `C` | `alpha`

Tools to aid in game development. The aim of these tools is to add an abstract
layer at drawing graphics, in such a way that it would be possible for a game
to be made once and compile everywhere (even on devices/platforms that do not
exist yet). It also includes a custom rasterizer, in order to allow 3d graphics
even on devices that do not support them. (so far it's only on a software level).

> This project was the foundation of the video game `dargite3d`.
> It has been abandon in favor of the programming language `avdl`,
> which uses similar techniques.
