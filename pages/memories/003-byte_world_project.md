## Byte World Project

`02.2017 - 04.2017`

A project to create 3d graphics, while avoiding floats. Although
I'm mainly making this to practice the math behing rasterization,
the aim with this project is to make "lightweight" 3d graphics,
that can run even on a software level. Obviously a game without floats has
lots of limitations (especially on rotations) but it is a creative idea.

> This project has been fused with `ddt` and is no longer active.
