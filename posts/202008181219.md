##The king is gone - Alpha Demo

<img src="images/the_king_is_gone-alpha-animated_cover-small.gif"/>

Made with my language [`avdl`](https://notabug.org/tomtsagk/avdl), this is a puzzle game
about running away, while unlocking doors that are in your way.
Each door gives a specific benefit that makes escaping easier, at least in
the right combination.

It is currently in alpha, and I've made some demo builds that show enough
gameplay to give an idea of what the game is about.
