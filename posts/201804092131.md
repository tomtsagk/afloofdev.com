<img src="images/software_rasteriser_console.gif" style="width:400px;"/>

just completed the most important part of a software rasterizer: perspective projection.
from a 3d point in cartesian coordinates, to a 2d pixel on the screen. this gif shows
this but using only ascii characters instead of actual colors.
