After spending more time than I would like to admit, I've just uploaded the first android port of "Shuffled Nightmares".

This is a one to one port of the PC projects. It has been tested on a variety of devices, including phones and tablets. It also has a demo version available, which can be used to confirm if it works as expected on a specific device, and get an idea of what the game is about.

Check it out on <a class="button" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.darkdimension.shuffled_nightmares">Google Play</a>
