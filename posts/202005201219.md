##New Patreon Page

I've started a patreon page, where I will be uploading
updates of projects I'm working on.
Currently plan to post in-progress updates of my newest project, for patrons, before I reach the point
of releasing it to the public.

The page can be found [here](https://www.patreon.com/darkdimension)
